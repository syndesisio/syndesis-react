have components called \"Apps\" that will define their own route handlers.\n *\n * @todo the IntegrationCreatorApp and IntegrationEditorApp could benefit from\n * some refactoring aimed to DRY the business logic that's embedded in every\n * page of the same type (especially the configuration ones).\n * Actually the IntegrationEditorApp is the result of a copy-paste of this folder\n * `syndesis/src/modules/integrations/pages/create/configure/editStep`,\n * with updated titles and links between the steps.\n * This is an hint that at least those 2 \"areas\" could be DRYed up, but it could\n * be worth exploring options to take it up a notch and figure out a way to\n * simplify also the other pages.\n */\nexport class IntegrationsModule extends React.Component {\n  public render()
